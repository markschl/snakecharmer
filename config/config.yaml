#### Software options ####

# For QIIME and Amptk, it is possible to configure the
# Conda environment, where the software is installed,
# allowing to switch between different versions.
# Note: only pipelines that are effectively used in the 'workflows'
# definition have to be listed here. Removing the others can actually
# speed up Snakemake
software:
  usearch:
    # Path to USEARCH  (download here: https://drive5.com/usearch/)
    # By default, assuming that the binary is in $PATH as 'usearch'
    binary: usearch
    # optional, if Snakemake was installed in Conda; otherwise it should be in $PATH
    snakemake_env: snakemake
    # https://github.com/markschl/uvsnake source and/or version
    uvsnake:
      tag: v0.1
      # commit: afec00c
      # path: <local path to downloaded repo>
  qiime:
    conda_env: qiime2-2022.11
  amptk:
    conda_env: amptk


#### Input files ####

input:
  # sample tables are grouped by sequencing technology, since
  # pipelines usually only handle some technologies
  illumina:
    # Path(s) to tab-separated sample table(s) with the following columns:
    # id, R1, R2 (R2 paths only with paired-end sequencing layout).
    # A flexible tool that assists with creating these sample tables is:
    # https://github.com/markschl/ngs-sample-tab
    # Both the output format 'simple' (-f simple) and 'qiime' (-f qiime) are valid
    run1: sample_file1.tsv
    run2: sample_file2.tsv
    # a special case are cases, where only reverse (R2) reads are provided:
    # there the forward and reverse primers are exchanged, which the system needs to know
    run3:
      samples: sample_file1.tsv
      reverse: true

# Multiple files with the same name in different directories are
# either pooled together before processing (if pool_duplicates is true)
# or a suffix number (_1, _2, etc.) is added to make the sample names
# unique (if pool_duplicates is false).
# Which samples were pooled is listed in 'results/samples.yaml' after
# running the 'config' or other commands.
pool_raw: false


##### Pipeline definition ####

# Each workflow needs two options:
#  cluster: name of a clustering/denoising method
#  taxonomy: either 'default' (all databases and methods listed
#    below under the 'taxonomy_dbs' and 'taxonomy_methods' options,
#    or a custom combination of database/method names
#     (see example in 'unoise_usearch' pipeline)
workflows:
  # UNOISE3 pipeline using VSEARCH for denoising
  unoise:
    cluster: usearch_unoise3  # { usearch_unoise3, qiime_dada2, amptk_unoise3, amptk_dada2 }
    taxonomy: default # using all taxonomy_dbs and taxonomy_methods
  # UNOISE3 pipeline using USEARCH for denoising and a custom combination
  # of taxonomy databases/assignment methods
  unoise_usearch:
    cluster: usearch_unoise3  # { usearch_unoise3, qiime_dada2, amptk_unoise3, amptk_dada2 }
    taxonomy:
      dbs:  # chooses specific 'taxonomy_dbs' (below)
        ITS: [unite_species]
      methods:  # chooses specific 'taxonomy_methods' (below)
        - sintax_90
    # Here, we choose USEARCH for all relevant tasks instead of VSEARCH.
    # *Note* that VSEARCH is still used for minor tasks such as sequence filtering,
    # where the outcome should anyway be the same between the two programs.
    # These settings simply overwrite the default settings found below
    # in this file. 
    # The settings hierarchy needs to be exactly the same as below.
    # You may run the 'config' rule first and then check the file 
    # `results/<pipeline>/config.yaml` to see if the settings were 
    # correctly overridden.
    settings:
      usearch:
        merge: { program: usearch }
        unoise: { program: usearch }
        otutab: { program: usearch }
  # QIIME / DADA2
  qiime_dada2:
    cluster: qiime_dada2  # { usearch_unoise3, qiime_dada2, amptk_unoise3, amptk_dada2 }
    taxonomy: default
  # Amptk with UNOISE3 clustering
  amptk_unoise:
    cluster: amptk_unoise3
    taxonomy: default
  # Amptk with Dada2 clustering
  amptk_dada2:
    # Note regarding the DADA2 settings: The Amptk DADA2 pipeline
    # still does read merging with U/VSEARCH before the denoising, followed by
    # a quality filtering step, which then forms the input for DADA2,
    # which is run without the learnErrors() step (except for PacBio).
    # It is thus a "hybrid" pipeline based on both U/VSEARCH and DADA2;
    # the quality filtering therefore uses the 'max_error_rate' from the
    # usearch -> filter and the 'expected_length' from the usearch -> merge
    # sections.
    cluster: amptk_dada2
    taxonomy: default

#### Files to compare with ASVs/OTUs using usearch_global (VSEARCH) ####

compare:
  my_comparison:
    file: path/to/seqs.fasta  # searched against denoised.fasta
    ident_threshold: 0.8  # min. identity (0 - 1)
  # The following settings apply to all comparisons unless
  # defined in the comparison settings.
  defaults:
    # the above ident_threshold overrides this setting, but if
    # not specified there, the identity threshould would be 0.9
    ident_threshold: 0.9
    # These settings are the defaults in 'default_settings'.
    # Ultimately, the whole 'default_settings' section is not required
    # if you are happy with these defaults.
    maxhits: 1  # only one hit per query (there could be up to 'maxaccepts' hits)
    maxaccepts: 64
    maxrejects: 64

#### Primers ####

primers:
  # Primers are grouped per marker. The marker name (in this case ITS) needs to be
  # present in the 'taxonomy_dbs' configuration. Only databases from the given
  # marker will be used for taxonomy assignments.
  # Furthermore, some marker-specific rules such as 'ITSx' will only be run with ITS sequences
  ITS:
    # Several primers can be specified. The desired combinations can be
    # specified as well (see 'combinations' below. Multiple primer combinations
    # may occur if:
    # - Different samples were amplified with different primers
    # - Some or all samples are a mix of different amplicons, which were pooled before indexing
    # The oligos may include adapter and/or linker sequences, but their position is not
    # required to be at the exact sequence start or end.
    # Each primer can further be a comma delimited list of oligos, which
    # were mixed together. However, they should still start at the same
    # nucleotide position to allow global trimming.
    # Also note that many pipelines (QIIME, Amptk) cannot deal with primer mixes.
    # In this case, the consensus sequence of all primers is currently used.
    # The consensus threshold is 50%, meaning that at each position,
    # 50% of the bases are represented in the consensus.
    # This may lead to some rare ambiguous variants being removed. However,
    # a higher threshold could lead to too many unspecific hits.
    # With a sufficiently high `max_error_rate`, this will not be a problem.
    # More options may be added in the future.
    # *Anchoring*: A sequence (list) can start with '^' to indicate that the
    # primer cannot occur internally, each read should start with the primer.
    # This may not be done by every pipeline.
    forward:
      - ITS3-KYO2: GGGATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA

    # or a list of combinations (see below)
    combinations: all
      ## Custom list of combinations:
      ## Every combination will obtain its own results directory
      ## The primer combination format must be: "forward...reverse"

#### Taxonomy assignment ####

# By default, every possible combination of databases and
# assignment methods is used. This can be changed by modifying
# the 'taxonomy' option in the 'pipelines' definion (above)

# Definition of all taxonomic databases used by default
# (sources are configured in taxonomy.yaml).
# Optional filters allow to only keep reference sequences
# with a certain taxonomic rank defined.
# TODO: More filtering or trimming options could be added
